# Company-Rating-Classifier
As we have seen manier times around us that people are confused about which company they should look for and which companies are really worth joining , other than FAANG's and other major product based or service based companies. In my friend circle, as a fresher I felt the same confusion among my friends and other peers too.

The basic way of figuring this out is to look for the reviews and rating given to the companies . But sometimes it's hard to really rely upon the reviews and ratings. The question arises " what if the ratings are tampered or fake? ".

So to overcome this problem we can use Machine Learning in predicting/Classifying the correct rating of the companies one is looking for.
But for any ML problem we need data. In this project I'll be using the technique 'Job scraping' for collecting or scraping data from the website.
